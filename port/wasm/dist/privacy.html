    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Pages on this domain and
      <a href="https://eicoop.netlify.app" target="_blank">eicoop.netlify.app</a> use
      <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank">goatcounter.com</a> for
      privacy-friendly analytics. Basic information about your visit and your browser is recorded to
      gauge interest and guide development. No personal information is recorded, no fingerprinting
      is performed, and recorded data are only available to the author as aggregate statistics. You
      can "opt out" of analytics by blocking the gc.zgo.at domain with a content blocker, e.g.
      uBlock Origin, but as a very privacy-conscious person myself, I don't believe that's
      warranted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For tools that may include confidential information directly in URLs, e.g. the CoopTracker
      with coop codes, since the URL you directly land on (but not the ones you later navigate to)
      is collected by the analytics service, the confidential information may leak into analytics
      logs, and leaked data could be accessed with some effort. In that case, I will not disclose
      the information without a compelling reason (haven't found one to date) and without confirming
      it is already public or having express permission. Also rest assured that I have zero interest
      in joining or even checking your coop, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools that ask for input like your player ID or coop code in order to display personalized
      information communicate with Egg, Inc.'s server through an intermediary due to browser
      restrictions preventing direct connectivity. The intermediary is a Cloudflare Workers domain
      under the author's control:
      <a href="https://workers.dev/" target="_blank">wasmegg.zw.workers.dev</a>. Confidential
      information used in communications through this domain is not logged.
